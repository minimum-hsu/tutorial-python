# Get Started with pytest

In this lesson, we will learn how to use `pytest`, a popular testing framework in Python. `pytest` makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases for your code.

```bash
# Install pytest if you haven't already
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the tests
pytest
```
