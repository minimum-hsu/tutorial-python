# Decorator: Flask Route Decorators

In this lesson, we will learn how to use decorators in a Flask web application. Decorators allow us to modify the behavior of functions or methods in a clean and reusable way.

## How to Run

To run the Flask application, follow these steps:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=api.py
flask run
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/hello`.
You can test the endpoints using a web browser or tools like `curl` or Postman.
