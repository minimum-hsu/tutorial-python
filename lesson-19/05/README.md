# Decorator: Logging with AWS Lambda Powertools

In this lesson, we will learn how to use decorators for logging in AWS Lambda functions using the AWS Lambda Powertools library. Decorators allow us to wrap our functions with additional functionality, such as logging.

## Test

To test the logging functionality, we can use the `pytest` framework.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -s
```
