You can open a Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) by simply typing `python` or `python3` in your terminal. This will start an interactive session where you can type Python code and see the results immediately.

Here's a simple example of using the REPL:

```python
$ python3
Python 3.14.0 (main, Oct  7 2025, 09:34:52) [Clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1+2
3
>>> _*3
9
```

In the example above, after calculating `1+2`, the result `3` is automatically stored in the special variable `_`. You can then use `_` in subsequent calculations, as shown with `_ * 3`, which evaluates to `9`. This feature is particularly useful for quick calculations and testing small code snippets without needing to assign results to named variables.
